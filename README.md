# Vespertina Design System

Vespertina Design System, a space-themed design system for my website and personal projects.

It's still a WIP, so parts are bound to move frequently. Currently, I'm building the component library with `React` and `Storybook`, but someday, I would like for it to be a tool to rapidly build prototypes and learn other web or mobile languages.
